    >The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
    <br>>The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.
    <br>>The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.
    <br>>[beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.
    <br>>[ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible.
    <br>>The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.
    <br>>The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

<!-- Link to Steam guide -->
<a class="link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1272978992&insideModal=0&requirelogin=1" target="_blank">Here is a great base tutorial for the ideal install scenario</a>
<br>
<a>I summarize this guide here:</a>

<!-- Ideal install-->
<a id="IdealInstall"></a>
<p style="font-size: x-large;font-weight: bold">The (now outdated) ideal scenario:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Install GTA IV from Steam
    <li> Sign in to Xbox Console Companion app on Windows 10
    <li> Start game from Steam and let it install the Microsoft Redistributable Pack's and GFWL, do not cancel or say "no" to any of these!
    <li> When you reach the main menu, click on LIVE (I recommend doing this before changing any graphical settings)
    <li> Sign in to GFWL with same account as you used on Xbox Console Companion app.
    <li> Tick auto sign in box. (It should automatically input your password after you type the email)
    <li> Sign in and play.
</ol> <br>

<!-- Fixes -->
<a id="Fixes"></a>
<p style="font-size: x-large;font-weight: bold">If this doesn't work, here is some help:</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold">First, here are some useful notes:</p> <p>Default install directory is most likely
    <a  style="font-style: italic;text-shadow: grey 1px 1px 1px">C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto IV\GTAIV</a><br>
    These fixes should also work with EFLC. <br>
    This is on patch 1.0.8.0 for IV and whatever the second latest is on EFLC.<br>
    Everything in <a class="link">red</a> is a link, other than that red example.<br>
    The files hosted on this site have not been modified and AFAIK are safe to use<br>
    Source codes for the majority of files hosted here can be found in a search on your preferred search engine</p>

<!-- Freezing -->
<a id="Freezing"></a>
<p style="font-size: x-large;font-weight: bold">Game freezing on startup, cutscenes or when alt+tab-ing:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Got to GTAIV.exe, right click and go to properties
    <li>Tick box "Disable fullscreen optimizations"
    <p>If this doesn't work, add "-windowed" to Steam launch options and use <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Zero3K/fullscreenizer" target="_blank">Fullscreenizer</a> to get fullscreen.<br>
    Note: I haven't tried Fullscreenzier with GTA IV but I've never had issues with it other than it being inconvenient.</p>
</ol>
<br>

<!-- GFWL issues -->
<a id="GFWL"></a>
<p style="font-size: x-large;font-weight: bold">Issues with GFWL:</p>
<p>If you can't sign in to GFWL:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Navigate to install folder of GFWL
    <li> Download this: <a class="link" href="AutoFirewall.zip">AUTO-FIREWALL</a><sup><a class="link" href="https://github.com/charlesdh/addfwrs">Source (I have modified this file)</a></sup>
    <li> Extract the Auto Allow batch file into the GFWL folder
    <li> Run it as admin and press enter to let it add firewall rules.
    <li> Try sign in again
</ol><p>If you still can't sign in:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Download and install IO Bit Uninstaller
    <li> Use it to uninstall GFWL (This will take a while because it will be searching the registry for left over entries)
    <li> Reboot
    <li> Download <a class="link" href="https://chopperhook.xyz/downloads/GFWL-GTAIV-2nd-Lastest.zip">this zip</a> and extract to desktop
    <li> Install as admin and sign in when on desktop<br>
    <li> When you launch GTA IV and try to sign in, you will be prompted to update GFWL,  this should work automatically, it will then close GFWL and GTA IV
    <li> When the game closes, wait for a minute or two before launching it again, when you try to sign in, it should work.<br>
    <a>If this complains about anything, use Auto Firewall tool above.</a>
</ol><br>

<!-- All settings stuck on low issue / VRAM issue -->
<a id="VRAM"></a>
<p style="font-size: x-large;font-weight: bold">"All settings stuck on low" fix:</p>
<p>Download this
<a class="link" href="commandline.txt" target="_blank">commandline.txt</a> and place it in GTA IV install directory.<br>
    I don't recommend playing on lowest settings, the performance gain is minimal due to bad optimization.<br><br>
    Note: On my RX 580 8GB, the game detected 3GB of VRAM automatically with no issues. <br>
    GTA IV will at very most use 2GB VRAM, so don't worry if only a fraction of your VRAM is detected.
</p>
<br>

<!--Simple Native Trainer -->
<a id="Trainer"></a>
<p style="font-size: x-large;font-weight: bold">Simple Native Trainer:</p>
<p>Download zip from <a class="link" href="ScriptHook1080.zip">here</a> and extract to install directory.<br>
If you have issues with this version, please use <a class="link" href="https://mega.nz/#!vNZi1IKb!ioQ9I3fc5pFnrT3WIFje3KzrZLpLLNKelOKH8BTlAnc" target="_blank">this</a> version instead</p>
<br>
<!-- Increasing Performance -->
<a id="Performance"></a>
<p style="font-size: x-large;font-weight: bold">Increasing Performance:</p>
<p>Here's what I recommend:<br><br>

    First, make sure you're getting the most from the hardware you're using. Since GTA IV hasn't been optimized for multi-core CPU's, overclocking is very useful.<br>
    If possible, favour increasing "turbo" clocks instead of going for an all-core overclock.<br>
    Then go to your GPU, make sure you have it running at a good speed. <br><br>

    Then for in game settings, avoid using the inbuilt texture filtering, use filtering in your graphics drivers settings instead.<br>
    Shadows have a large impact on performance on most systems, so if necessary, disable them. Same goes for the three sliders for render distance<br>
    and vehicles, keeping these sliders on 50 is usually fine.<br><br>

    If necessary, you could resort to modding the game to get the best performance, search for "timecycle draw distance decrease" if your FPS is really bad.<br><br>

    Here is what I use for my commandline.txt: <br><br>
    -forcehighqualitymirrors<br>
    -forcer2vb<br>
    -noBlockOnLostFocus<br>
    -reflectionquality 4<br>
    -reflectionresolution 2048<br>
    -waterquality 4<br>
    -waterreflectionquality 4<br>
    <br><br>
    This is more for higher quality but forces better utilization of hardware through 64bit mirror rendering and more VRAM used from higher reflection resolution.<br>
    I also use a 3500 render distance (Timecycle distance draw distance increase) which actually increases my FPS since more RAM and VRAM are being used.<br><br>
    Unfortunately, if you have a non-overclockable high core count CPU with low IPC (Instructions per cycle), I don't think there are any ways to improve the performance when it is due to a CPU bottleneck like this. <br>Due to this over-reliance on IPC, Ryzen 3000 and high clock Intel chips will result in the best FPS 
<br><br><br>
There are plenty of guides on YouTube, old GTA forums and on Steam for getting the best performance, here are some links to them:<br><br>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;font-weight: bold">2020 Stuff:</p>
<p>As of 23/03/2020, it is still possible to play GTA IV online using version 1.0.8.0. In other words, don't update.<br>
It is also supposedly possible to play online on 1.0.4.0 using the following mod: <a class="link" href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/950418-iv-1040-multiplayer-enabler/" target="_blank">"1.0.4.0 Multiplayer Enabler"</a>.<br>
Here is a mirror to this forum: <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200323011710/https://gtaforums.com/topic/950418-iv-1040-multiplayer-enabler/" target="_blank">"1.0.4.0 Multiplayer Enabler"</a><br><br>
Here is a pack to downgrade to 1.0.8.0 to be able to play online: <a class="link" href="https://dropmefiles.com/JhNQQ" target="_blank">Link</a> - <a class="link" href="GTAIVCE_to_1.0.8.0_and_1.1.3.0_downgrader.zip" target="_blank">Mirror</a><br>
Here's a different downgrader, supposedly for the same 2020 version to patch 8 downgrade but it looks like it's cracked: <a class=link href="https://dropmefiles.com/fsgo2" target="_blank">Link</a> - <a class=link href="downgrader 2.1-main-folder-files.zip" target="_blank">Mirror</a><br><br>
